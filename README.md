### List nft to the market

Alice adds an NFT in Add NFT and sets its price to 3MTR, it is displayed on MarketPlace and others can buy it.

### Co-investment

Bob found it, but he didn't have enough money, he only paid 1 MTR, and he expected the future price of this NFT to be 4 MTR. Carol also found it and paid the remaining 2 MTR, which he expects the future price of this NFT to be 6 MTR.

### Re-list

Because the total amount paid by Bob and Carol has reached the price set by Alice, the NFT is traded, Alice gets 3 MTR, and the NFT is relisted. The new price listed is 5 MTR, which is the average (4+6)/2 of the expected prices entered by Bob and Carol at the time of purchase.

### Co-benefits

Dave admired this NFT very much, so he directly paid 5 MTR to buy it. When this NFT is purchased by Dave, the income will be distributed to Bob and Carol proportionally. Bob gets 3.33 MTR(2/3\*5) and Carol gets 1.66 MTR (1/3\*5). Bob and Carol invested in the NFT together, and they gained 1.33 MTR (3.33-2) and 9MTR (1.66-1) respectively.
